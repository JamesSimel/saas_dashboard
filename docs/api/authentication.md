# API Authentication

## Overview
This document outlines the authentication mechanisms used in the Analytics Pro API to ensure secure access to data.

## Authentication Methods
- **OAuth 2.0**: For third-party integrations.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For stateless authentication across HTTP requests.

## Implementing Authentication
1. **Obtain an API Key**: Register on the platform to receive an API key.
2. **Include the API Key in Request Headers**:      ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.analyticspro.com/data   ```

## Security Practices
- Never expose your API keys in your frontend code.
- Rotate your API keys periodically.

## Error Handling
- `401 Unauthorized`: Indicates that the provided API key is invalid or missing.
- `403 Forbidden`: Indicates that the API key does not have permissions to perform the requested operation.
